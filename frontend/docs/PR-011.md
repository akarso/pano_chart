# PR-011 — Detail Screen UX (Candles, Focused Analysis)

## Goal

Design and implement the **detail / deep-dive screen** for a single symbol, optimized for readable price analysis while remaining intentionally uncluttered.

This screen complements the overview grid by offering **depth without configuration overload**.

---

## Scope

**Included**

* Detail screen layout and composition
* Candle chart rendering usage
* Minimal contextual metadata (symbol, timeframe)
* Favourites interaction

**Explicitly Excluded**

* Per-symbol settings
* Indicator overlays (RSI, EMA, etc.)
* Chart interactivity (zoom, pan, crosshair)
* Timeframe or range overrides

---

## Design Principles

* One symbol, one focus
* Readability over density
* No configuration branching while analysing
* Consistency with overview screen semantics

---

## Configuration Model

### Global Configuration Alignment

The detail screen must:

* Use the **same timeframe** as the overview screen
* Use the **same lookback range** as the overview screen

Rules:

* No overrides on the detail screen
* Any changes to timeframe/range occur in **global settings only**

This ensures:

* Predictable mental mapping
* Easy comparison between overview and detail

---

## Layout Structure

### Top Bar

Contents:

* Symbol name (prominent)
* Timeframe label (secondary)
* Favourite toggle (icon-only)

Rules:

* No dropdowns
* No menus
* No numeric clutter

---

### Main Chart Area

* Uses `CandleSeriesChartRenderer`
* Occupies majority of vertical space
* Fixed padding around chart

Visual constraints:

* Dark mode only
* Red / green candles
* No axes, labels, grid, or overlays

---

### Secondary Information (Optional, Minimal)

Allowed (optional):

* % change over visible window
* Last price (small, non-dominant)

Rules:

* Secondary information must not compete with chart
* No volume, no indicators

---

## Interaction Model

Supported interactions:

* Navigate back to overview
* Toggle favourite status

Explicitly unsupported:

* Zooming
* Panning
* Scrubbing
* Timeframe switching

---

## Settings Philosophy

Settings are:

* Centralized
* Screen-scoped, not symbol-scoped

Structure:

* Global settings

  * Theme (dark, fixed for now)
  * Data refresh behavior (future)

* Overview settings

  * Column count
  * Default view mode

* Detail settings

  * Reserved for future (e.g. indicators)

Detail screen itself contains **no settings UI**.

---

## Performance Considerations

* Single chart render at a time
* No animations
* Avoid unnecessary rebuilds on navigation

---

## Tests

### Required

* Widget test: detail screen renders candle chart
* Widget test: symbol + timeframe visible
* Widget test: favourite toggle updates state

### Explicitly Not Required

* Golden tests
* Interaction gesture tests
* Snapshot comparisons

---

## Acceptance Criteria

PR-011 is complete when:

* Selecting a symbol opens a focused candle-based detail screen
* No per-symbol settings are present
* Timeframe and range match overview
* Favourite action is available and isolated
* Visual design remains uncluttered and readable

---

## Follow-ups

Planned next PRs:

* **PR-012** — Symbol scoring (domain)
* **PR-013** — Ranking use case
* **PR-014** — Sorting controls in overview

---

## Non-Goals

* Indicator configuration
* Advanced chart tooling
* User customization
* Multi-symbol comparison

This PR defines the **analysis endpoint** of the v1 user journey.
