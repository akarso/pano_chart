# PR-001 — Flutter App Skeleton & Project Foundation

## Purpose

Establish the **Flutter application skeleton** that will consume the frozen backend API defined in `docs/PR-011.md`.

This PR creates the minimum viable frontend structure required to safely iterate on features without rework.

No product features are implemented.

---

## References

* `AGENTS.md` — global collaboration rules
* `COMMON.md` — shared domain & API semantics
* `docs/PR-011.md` — frozen backend API contract

Frontend must treat the backend API as **read-only and stable**.

---

## Scope (Hard Lock)

### ✅ Included

* Flutter project scaffold
* App entry point
* Basic routing setup
* Dependency injection foundation
* Environment configuration handling
* Linting & static analysis configuration

### ❌ Excluded

* UI screens
* Networking implementation
* State management logic
* Business rules
* Visual design

If it renders market data, it does not belong here.

---

## Tech Stack (Locked)

* Flutter (stable channel)
* Dart (latest stable)
* Target platforms:

  * Android
  * iOS

No web or desktop targets in Phase 1.

---

## Folder Structure

```
/frontend/lib/
  app/
    app.dart
    router.dart
  bootstrap/
    main.dart
  core/
    config/
    di/
  shared/
  main.dart

/frontend/test/
  bootstrap/
  app/
```

Structure is optimized for **feature growth without refactors**.

---

## Application Responsibilities

### Entry Point

* Single `main()` function
* Explicit app bootstrap
* No global mutable state

### Routing

* Centralized router definition
* Placeholder root route only

### Dependency Injection

* Explicit DI container setup
* No service locator anti-patterns

---

## Configuration

The app must support:

* API base URL
* Build flavor (dev / prod)

Configuration may be provided via:

* Dart compile-time variables
* Constructor injection

No `.env` files in this PR.

---

## Testing Requirements

### Required Test Cases

* `test/bootstrap/main_test.dart`

  * App starts without exceptions

* `test/app/app_test.dart`

  * Root widget builds

No golden tests in this PR.

---

## Implementation Constraints

* No UI widgets beyond placeholders
* No HTTP clients
* No third-party state management libraries

Keep this PR boring and safe.

---

## Definition of Done (PR-001)

PR-001 is considered **done** only when **all** conditions below are met:

* [ ] Flutter app builds on Android & iOS
* [ ] App starts successfully
* [ ] Folder structure matches specification
* [ ] Static analysis passes with no warnings
* [ ] Tests pass
* [ ] No backend assumptions beyond PR-011
* [ ] No unused dependencies
* [ ] PR is reviewable in under 20 minutes

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

* No theming
* No navigation animations
* No error handling UI

---

## Reviewer Checklist

Reviewer must confirm:

* Skeleton is minimal and future-proof
* No premature abstractions
* Backend contract is respected

---

## Guiding Principle

Frontend foundations should disappear once features arrive.
