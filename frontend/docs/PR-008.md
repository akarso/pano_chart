# PR-008 — Line Chart Renderer (Overview Only)

## Goal

Introduce a **line chart renderer** optimized for fast market scanning in the overview screen.

This PR delivers the *first concrete visual representation* of series data, aligned with the linear-first product direction established in PR-007.

---

## Scope

**Included**

* Line chart renderer implementation
* Minimal visual grammar for scanning (shape over precision)
* Integration at rendering boundary introduced in PR-007

**Explicitly Excluded**

* Candle rendering
* Indicators (RSI, EMA, etc.)
* User-configurable toggles
* Interactivity (zoom, pan, crosshair)

---

## Design Principles

* Optimize for **pattern recognition**, not price accuracy
* Reduce cognitive load
* Favor performance and simplicity over configurability
* Line chart is **overview-only**

---

## Rendering Rules

The line chart renderer must:

* Use **close prices only**
* Normalize values to available vertical space
* Apply subtle padding (top/bottom) to avoid flat-edge clipping
* Render a single continuous polyline

Visual constraints:

* No axes
* No labels
* No grid
* No price text
* No colors encoding meaning (single neutral color)

---

## Implementation Details

### Renderer

Implement a concrete renderer:

```dart
class LineSeriesChartRenderer implements SeriesChartRenderer {
  @override
  Widget build(
    BuildContext context, {
    required CandleSeries series,
    required SeriesViewMode viewMode,
  }) {
    // viewMode must be SeriesViewMode.line
  }
}
```

Rules:

* Renderer must assert or guard that `viewMode == SeriesViewMode.line`
* CandleSeries is the single input (no derived DTOs)

---

### Rendering Technique

* Use `CustomPainter`
* Precompute normalized points before painting
* Avoid allocations in paint loop where possible

---

## Tests

### Required

* Unit test: maps CandleSeries closes → normalized points
* Unit test: empty or single-point series renders safely
* Widget test: renderer builds without error

### Explicitly Not Required

* Golden tests
* Performance benchmarks

---

## Acceptance Criteria

PR-008 is complete when:

* Line renderer exists and is wired via `SeriesChartRenderer`
* Overview screen uses line renderer by default
* No candle rendering is affected
* No interactivity is present
* Performance is acceptable for 30+ charts on screen

---

## Follow-ups

Planned next PRs:

* **PR-009** — Candle chart renderer (detail view)
* **PR-010** — Overview screen layout & composition

---

## Non-Goals

* Styling polish
* Indicator overlays
* User preferences
* Deep-dive UI

This PR intentionally delivers the *minimum viable visual signal*.
