# PR-006 — Overview Grid (Read‑Only, Scrollable)

## Purpose

Introduce the **first visible product feature**: a read‑only overview grid displaying multiple candle series charts on a single scrollable screen.

This PR validates the core product idea without interaction, indicators, or customization.

## Scope (Hard Lock)

### ✅ Included

* Overview screen widget
* Scrollable grid / list of mini charts
* Data loading via `GetCandleSeries`
* Basic loading & empty states

### ❌ Excluded

* User interaction (tap, zoom, pan)
* Indicators (RSI, volume overlays, etc.)
* Symbol selection UI
* Settings or customization
* Error recovery UI

If it adds controls, it does not belong here.

---

## UX Definition

### Overview Screen

* Single screen
* Vertically scrollable
* Displays multiple symbols stacked or in a grid

Each item contains:

* Symbol label
* Timeframe label
* Mini candlestick chart

Charts must be visually simplified and consistent.

---

## Data Flow

```
OverviewScreen
  → OverviewViewModel (or equivalent)
    → GetCandleSeries use case
```

UI must not talk to HTTP or adapters directly.

---

## Layout Rules

* Use `ListView` or `GridView`
* Fixed item height
* No nested scroll views
* Must handle 20–50 items smoothly

---

## Charting Constraints

* Use a minimal custom painter or lightweight chart library
* No animations
* No gesture handling

Charts are informational, not interactive.

---

## Loading & Empty States

* Initial loading indicator
* Per‑item empty state if candle list is empty

Failures may surface as generic placeholders.

---

## Testing Requirements

### Required Test Cases

* `OverviewScreen_rendersList`
* `OverviewScreen_showsLoadingState`
* `OverviewScreen_handlesEmptyCandles`

Widget tests only. No golden tests yet.

---

## Implementation Constraints

* Keep widget tree shallow
* No state management libraries
* Prefer `ChangeNotifier` or simple state holder

---

---

## Reviewer Checklist

* Data flow respects architecture
* No business logic in widgets
* Charts are lightweight

---

## Guiding Principle

Clarity beats cleverness at this stage.
